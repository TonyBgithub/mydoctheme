My name is Tony Briget, and I'm a technical writer and video producer based near Paris, France. For more details, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-briget-52640017a/) and my [Work at SAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENAqA82wdo). I am currently working on expanding my knowledge of API documentation and coding in general, exploring new areas and experimenting with code snippets that I include in my projects. 

I built this documentation website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. Most of what you can see on this website I wrote in Markdown or plain HTML. To do this, I've had to learn from Tom Johnson, an API documentation specialist who works for Amazon. See his [API documentation course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_introtoapis.html).

I have experience with OxygenXML and DITA, but I am always looking for more efficient ways to write, display and review documentation. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my work. 

Tony
