## Bio
My name is Tony Briget, and I'm a technical writer and videomaker based near Paris, France. For more details, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-briget-52640017a/) I am currently working on expanding my knowledge of API documentation and coding in general, exploring new areas and experimenting with code snippets that I include in my projects. 

## What I do
Last year, part of my work at SAP involved shooting and editing documentation videos. See [my work on SAP's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENAqA82wdo). 

I built this documentation website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. Most of what you read on this website I wrote in Markdown or plain HTML. I learned this from Tom Johnson, an API documentation specialist who works for Amazon. See his [API documentation course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_introtoapis.html).

I have experience with OxygenXML and DITA, but I'm always looking for more efficient ways to write, display and review documentation. 

I'm currently writing documentation on how to create and implement a newsletter signup app using Node.js and the Mailchimp API. Here is what the app looks like: [Newsletter Signup App](https://tb-newsletter.herokuapp.com/)

Thanks for taking the time to read my work.

Tony
